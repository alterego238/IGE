Generate a dialogue between a user and an assistant based on the following rules and given script segment and code snippet.

1. The user edits game script segments using natural language during interactions with the assistant.
2. The assistant interacts with the user to achieve interactive game development. The assistant guides the user in editing game script segments, generates corresponding code snippets, and interacts with the user through dialogue.
3. Each turn of the assistant's output should include three processes: "script", "code", and "utter", corresponding to three blocks:  <script></script>, <code></code>, <utter></utter>. Formally, these three blocks must exist, even if the content is empty.
4. The 'script' process: The assistant generates the game script segment based on the user's input of the current turn. Return modifications to the script as changes, rather than returning the entire script. The script is a Python dict, so you can use simple Python code to represent modifications to it, such as: script['xxx'] = 'xxx'. The 'script' process should be enclosed using '<script>' tag.
5. The 'code' process: The assistant generates the corresponding Python code snippet based on the game script segment from the 'script' process. The complete code is a CustomGame class that inherits from GameBase class, but only the methods related to the given script segment need to be generated. The 'code' process should be enclosed using '<code>' tag.
6. The 'utter' process: The assistant interacts with the user, including responding to the user's input of the current turn, summarizing the results of the current turn, and guiding the user to continue with the next turn of interaction. The 'utter' process should be enclosed using '<utter>' tag.
7. The script segment and code snippet have already been provided. In the assistant's 'script' and 'code' process, use the given script segment and code snippet; do not write your own.
8. The assistant does not know about the existence of the script segment in the dialogue and needs to obtain it from the user's input.
9. The given script segment and code snippet are essentially an outline of the plot development. The assistant's 'script' and 'code' process must be entirely derived from or inferred from the user's input. The user's input should be more natural language-based and not a direct copy of the given script segement.
10. The dialogue must cover and only cover the given script segment, and no other content should appear.
11. Output format requirements: Use the following format. There should be no empty lines within the user or assistant utterances.
Example format:
user: 
...

assistant: 
<script>
...
</script>
<code>
...
</code>
<utter>
...
</utter>


# Example 1
## script segment:
Phase:
    dealx: Deal x cards to each player.

## code snippet:
def dealx(self, x):
    for i in range(x):
        for p in self.players:
            self.players[p].hole += [self.deck.pop()]

## dialogue:
user:
There should be a Phase called 'dealx' that deals 'x' cards to each player.

assistant:
<script>
script['Phase']['dealx'] = 'Deal x cards to each player.'
</script>
<code>
def dealx(self, x):
    for i in range(x):
        for p in self.players:
            self.players[p].hole += [self.deck.pop()]
</code>
<utter>
OK. The phase 'dealx' has been added. 
</utter>


# Example 2
## script segment:
Phase:
    dealx: Deal x cards to each player.

## code snippet:
def dealx(self, x):
    for i in range(x):
        for p in self.players:
            self.players[p].hole += [self.deck.pop()]

## dialogue:
user:
Add a Phase called dealx.

assistant:
<script>
</script>
<code>
</code>
<utter>
Good, please provide the details of the Phase 'dealx'.
</utter>

user:
Deal x cards to each player.

assistant:
<script>
script['Phase']['dealx'] = 'Deal x cards to each player.'
</script>
<code>
def dealx(self, x):
    for i in range(x):
        for p in self.players:
            self.players[p].hole += [self.deck.pop()]
</code>
<utter>
OK. The phase 'dealx' has been added. 
</utter>


# Example 3
## script segment:
Config:
    Number of players: 3
    Min bet: 10
    Max bet: 1000
    Suit: ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
    Suit have rank: False
    Card value rank: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]
    Card combinations rank: [High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush]

## code snippet:
def config(self):
    self.n_players = 3
    self.min_bet = 10
    self.max_bet = 1000
    self.suit = ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
    self.suit_have_rank = False
    self.value = [str(v) for v in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]]
    self.card_combinations_rank = ['High Card', 'Pair', 'Two Pair', 'Three of a Kind', 'Straight', 'Flush', 'Full House', 'Four of a Kind', 'Straight Flush']

## dialogue:
user:
There should be 3 players. The minimum bet should be 10 and the maximum bet should be 1000.

assistant:
<script>
script['Config']['Number of players'] = 3
script['Config']['Min bet'] = 10
script['Config']['Max bet'] = 1000
</script>
<code>
def config(self):
    self.n_players = 3
    self.min_bet = 10
    self.max_bet = 1000
</code>
<utter>
Great! We've set up the number of players and the betting range. Now, what about the suits and card value rank in the deck?
</utter>

user:
I want to use 4 suits: H, D, C, S. The card ranks should be from 2 to 12 and an additional rank 1.

assistant:
<script>
script['Config']['Suit'] = ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
script['Config']['Card value rank'] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]
</script>
<code>
def config(self):
    self.n_players = 3
    self.min_bet = 10
    self.max_bet = 1000
    self.suit = ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
    self.value = [str(v) for v in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]]
</code>
<utter>
Perfect! The suits and card value rank have been configured. Do you need to rank the suits or should we ignore suit ranking?
</utter>

user:
No need to rank the suits.

assistant:
<script>
script['Config']['Suit have rank'] = False
</script>
<code>
def config(self):
    self.n_players = 3
    self.min_bet = 10
    self.max_bet = 1000
    self.suit = ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
    self.suit_have_rank = False
    self.value = [str(v) for v in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]]
</code>
<utter>
Got it! Suits won't have any inherent ranking. What about the card combinations rank? You can freely arrange the following card combinations: High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush.
</utter>

user:
High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush

assistant:
<script>
script['Config']['Card combinations rank'] = ['High Card', 'Pair', 'Two Pair', 'Three of a Kind', 'Straight', 'Flush', 'Full House', 'Four of a Kind', 'Straight Flush']
</script>
<code>
def config(self):
    self.n_players = 3
    self.min_bet = 10
    self.max_bet = 1000
    self.suit = ['H', 'D', 'C', 'S']
    self.suit_have_rank = False
    self.value = [str(v) for v in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1]]
    self.card_combinations_rank = ['High Card', 'Pair', 'Two Pair', 'Three of a Kind', 'Straight', 'Flush', 'Full House', 'Four of a Kind', 'Straight Flush']
</code>
<utter>
Good! The configuration is complete.
