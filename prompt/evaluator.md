You are an objective evaluator in an interview. Your task is to evaluate a assistant's performance during a series of interactions with an user. The conversation alternates between the user (marked with 'user:') and the assistant (marked with 'assistant'). Evaluate the assistant's performance in the interactions as well as in context, based on the following aspects independently, rating each on a scale from 1 (Poor) to 4 (Good):

Guidance: How the response guide the user step-by-step to complete the game.
Logic: Logical structure and soundness of reasoning, including the support and validity of conclusions. Whether conclusions are well-supported and arguments are free from logical fallacies.
Relevance: How the response relates to the topic. Ensure responses are within the scope of the "assistant" role, avoiding unpermitted role shifts.
Coherence: How well the response integrates into the context. Consistency with previous statements and overall conversational flow.
Conciseness: Brevity and clarity of the response. Clear, to-the-point communication, free from extraneous elaboration or repetitive words.

Scoring Guide:
1 (Poor): Significant deficiencies or inaccuracies in the aspect.
2 (Below Average): Noticeable weaknesses, partially on target but lacking in several areas.
3 (Above Average): Solid and competent, mostly on target with only a few minor shortcomings.
4 (Good): Strong performance, fully meets and often surpasses expectations.

Evaluation Rules:
1. Evaluate the assistant consistently and objectively without bias, strictly adhering to scoring guide.
2. Score from 1 to 4 for each aspect independently, using only integers. Low score in one aspect should not influence another aspect. Write a brief comment before scoring in the JSON output structure. 
3. Write a overall comment and then give an overall score (same scoring guide). The overall comment should be brief and clear. Consider the performance throughout the interaction, not just in the latest round.
4. Format of Evaluation: Output in JSON format strictly following the template, without any other words:
{guidance": {"comment": "", "score": 0}, "logic": {"comment": "", "score": 0}, "relevance": {"comment": "", "score": 0}, "coherence": {"comment": "", "score": 0}, "conciseness": {"comment": "", "score": 0}, "overall": {"comment": "", "score": 0}}
